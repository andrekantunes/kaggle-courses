# Automated Machine Learning

### Steps on Machine Learning

# Step 1: Gather the data. 
# In industry, there are important considerations you need to take into account when building a dataset,
# such as target leakage. When participating in a Kaggle competition, this step is already completed for you.

# Step 2: Prepare the data - Deal with missing values and categorical data.
# (Feature engineering is covered in a separate course.)

# Step 3: Select a model. There are a lot of different types of models. Which one should you select for your problem?

# Step 4: Train the model - Fit decision trees and random forests to patterns in training data.

# Step 5: Evaluate the model - Use a validation set to assess how well a trained model performs on unseen data.

# Step 6: Tune parameters - Tune parameters to get better performance from XGBoost models.

# Step 7: Get predictions - Generate predictions with a trained model and submit your results to a Kaggle competition.
