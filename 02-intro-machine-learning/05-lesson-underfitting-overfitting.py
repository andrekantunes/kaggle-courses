# Lesson 5 - Underfitting and Overfitting

# When we divide the houses amongst many leaves, we also have fewer houses in each leaf.
# Leaves with very few houses will make predictions that are quite close to those homes' actual values,
# but they may make very unreliable predictions for new data (because each prediction is based on only a few houses).

# This is a phenomenon called overfitting, where a model matches the training data almost perfectly,
# but does poorly in validation and other new data

# At an extreme, if a tree divides houses into only 2 or 4, each group still has a wide variety of houses.
# Resulting predictions may be far off for most houses, even in the training data
# (and it will be bad in validation too for the same reason). 
# When a model fails to capture important distinctions and patterns in the data, 
# so it performs poorly even in training data, that is called underfitting.

# Find the sweet spot between underfitting and overfitting
