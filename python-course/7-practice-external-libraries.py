# Practice 7 - External libraries

# Question 1 -

# After completing the exercises on lists and tuples, Jimmy noticed that, according to his estimate_average_slot_payout function,
# the slot machines at the Learn Python Casino are actually rigged against the house, and are profitable to play in the long run.

# Starting with $200 in his pocket, Jimmy has played the slots 500 times, recording his new balance in a list after each spin.
# He used Python's matplotlib library to make a graph of his balance over time:

# Import the jimmy_slots submodule
from learntools.python import jimmy_slots

# Call the get_graph() function to get Jimmy's graph
graph = jimmy_slots.get_graph()
graph

def prettify_graph(graph):
    graph.set_title("Results of 500 slot machine pulls")
    # Make the y-axis begin at 0
    graph.set_ylim(bottom=0)
    # Label the y-axis
    graph.set_ylabel("Balance")
    # Bonus: format the numbers on the y-axis as dollar amounts
    # An array of the values displayed on the y-axis (150, 175, 200, etc.)
    ticks = graph.get_yticks()
    # Format those values into strings beginning with dollar sign
    new_labels = ['${}'.format(int(amt)) for amt in ticks]
    # Set the new labels
    graph.set_yticklabels(new_labels)

graph = jimmy_slots.get_graph()
prettify_graph(graph)

# Question 2 -
